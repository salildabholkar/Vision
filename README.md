# Vision
Computer Vision related projects I have worked on

## Current projects:
* [Multi-image panorama creation](Panorama) - Creating a panorama from individual images using SIFT
* [German Traffic Sign Classifier](Traffic%20Sign%20Classifier/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb) - Used a deep CNN to identify traffic signs


## Running these projects

### General Requirements
* python 3
* pip 3

### Clone the project
Clone the project to your local machine using:

    git@github.com:salildabholkar/Vision.git

### Run the desired project:
Make sure `python 3` is being used by doing `python --version`

The individual project directories may have specific instructions on how to run them
